  <h2>Introduction</h2>


  <p>

  This week we will be helping Heros Inc., develop and test some
  inventions for escaping the Minotaur in a Labyrinth.  The problem is
  that the Minotaur knows his dungeon well and always takes the
  shortest path to the adventurer. On the plus side the millennia have
  caught up to the beast so most adventurers can keep pace with him.
  In order to test some inventions, we are going to simulate the
  labyrinth with a graph, and we can simulate certain
  characteristics of the adventurer by the way she picks her next
  step.  For example, a poor unequipped adventurer might have to
  resort to picking the next step in a completely random way, whereas
  the smart adventurer with the Sight-o-Matic (&copy; Heros Inc.) will
  know the next step to on the shortest path to the exit.

  <h2>Part I -- Representing the Labyrinth as a graph</h2>

  <p>

  For the Labyrinth, we will represent every intersection as a node
  and the edges as the possible paths leading away from the node.  It
  is important to make sure that all your nodes are connected, that is
  every node is reachable from every other node by following the
  edges, or else there will be parts of your Labyrinth that are
  unreachable.  You will need to provide your desired maze, see the 
  template for the example below.

  </p>

  <p>

  In this graph node 0 is in the top left hand corner and the nodes
  are named 0 - 53 from left to right.  Feel free to make several
  other mazes, I suggest writing them on paper then transferring the
  edgelists to the screen.
  </p>

  <h2>Part II -- Making the simulator</h2>
  <p>
  
  In order to sell the products, Heros Inc. would really like some
  visuals to convince their buyers.  Nothing like a bit of gore and
  blood to show someone how far a little prevention will take them.
  </p>
  <p>

  Now we have our maze we are ready to make our simulation.  In order
  to get an animation of the world you will be making an
  "obect-oriented" function (as in your <a
  href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-20.html">text</a>),
  and using the <tt>world.ss</tt> teachpack (see the helpdesk and your
  template for use of the world.ss).  With the required functions
  <tt>react</tt> for reacting to tick events and <tt>draw</tt> for
  producing an image of the world, and any other state you might think
  you need. Also the <tt>react</tt> function will need to test to see
  if the adventurer has won (or gotten to the exit, which I just set
  to be the 0 node) or if the Minotaur has won (i.e. the two crossed
  paths) and if so call the <tt>end-of-time</tt> function..

  </p>

    <p>

  The adventurer strategies should take some inputs (you decide) and
  output the next node that the adventurer advances too, an alternate
  design would be to put the strategies in the world to get some other
  state information.  Since the
  Minotaur always goes straight for the player, you don't need to
  input a strategy for him, just use my function based on Dijkstra's
  Algorithm.  You should make at least four new strategies for the
  adventurer.  The <tt>random-neighbor</tt> where you pick a
  random neighbor and advance has been provided.  Other possiblities include the <tt>Sight-O-Matic</tt> where the
  adventurer goes straight for the exit, <tt>Torch</tt> where you
  are able to see if the Minotaur is one of the neighboring nodes,
  <tt>QuickWall</tt> which allows an adventurer can seal a passage way for
  every QuickWall she has, any combination of other strategies, or
  whatever else you can think up.  Be creative, remember you want the
  most successful strategy.

  </p>

  <p>

  Here is an example of my output.  Also you should note that you have
  to change your code and re-evaluate to get a different
  simulation up for each strategy.

  <h2>Part III -- Extra Credit - Visualization</h2>
  <p>
  While the visualization is nice, the quants in the room want to see
  some more data.  To make a better argument do a Monte Carlo
  simulation where a function will call the different strategies on
  the different mazes you created putting the adventurer at random
  node with a large number of trials (100 or so).  The reports the
  number of eaten adventurers for each product.

  <h2>Turning Everything in</h2>
  <p>
  If you did not use my graph library, then turn in both the graph
  library and the assignment to chalk; otherwise, only submit the assignment.
