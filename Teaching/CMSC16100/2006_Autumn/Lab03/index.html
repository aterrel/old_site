  <h2>The Mandelbrot Set</h2>
  <p> 
  The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers {c} such that the iteration on the function f<sub>c</sub>(0) is always bounded, where:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;">f<sub>c</sub>(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c</div><br/>
  <p>
  To check for boundedness, it is sufficent to check if the magnitude of any iteration becomes greater than 2. For example to check if 1+i is in the set:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;">| f<sub>1+i</sub>(0) | = | 0<sup>2</sup> + 1+i | = (sqrt 2)<br/>
   | f<sub>1+i</sub>(f<sub>1+i</sub>(0)) | = | (1+i)<sup>2</sup> + 1+i | = | 1 + 3i | = (sqrt 10)<br/></div>
  <p>
  Since |f<sub>1+i</sub><sup>2</sup>(0)| > 2, we know that the function is not bounded.  We say the that for 1+i, it escaped on the second iteration.  For our lab we will be coloring different points in the complex plane according to when they escape.  To generate the Mandelbrot set we do so by keeping those points which do not escape with a given number of iterations.  
  </p>
  <p>
  The goal of this lab is to make a function "mandelbrot" that takes a stepsize, number of pixels, lower left real coordinate, and a lower left complex coordinate and produces a picture of the Mandelbrot set on the complex plane. Below I will give you some code and plans to help you along the process, which you are free to use or ignore. Here is an example of my output.

  <h3>Language and Teachpack</h3>
  <p>
  One of the goals of this lab is to get you to use the let and lambda features of Scheme.  Sure you can write the whole thing without it, but with it things are much smaller and easier to read.  Because the teaching languages restrict you so much, I suggest you use the <strong>PLT</strong>-><strong>Pretty Big</strong> language.  You will also need the <tt>image.ss</tt> teachpack again.  Also make sure you are using a current version of DrScheme (>= v300), if you don't have one you can log on as guest in the MacLab and find a recent version.  Please put what language and teachpack you use at the beginning of your definitions window so I know which to use, for example:

  <h3>Determining When a Point Escapes</h3>

  <p>
  At some point you will need to determine when the point escapes, and then you can choose a color for that point.  My suggestion is to write a function using iteration that either returns when the point escapes or the maximum number of iterations allowed.  For example, my function takes the real part of c, the imaginary part of c, and the maximum iterations, so for our example above I would have:
  </p>
  <pre>
  > (f_c^n_max 1 1 10)
  1</pre>
  <p>
  As a reminder about complex numbers, let y = a + bi and z = c + di, where a,b,c, and d are all real numbers. The real part of y is a and imaginary part is b. The product of y and z multiply like polynomials (except i<sup>2</sup>=-1):</p>
  <div style="text-align:center;"> y*z = (a + bi) * (c + di) = ((a*c) - (b*d)) + ((a*d) + (b*c)) i</div><br/>
  <p> 
  Finally the magnitude of y is:
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;"> |y| = (sqrt (a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>))</div><br/>
  <p>
  The complex plane is a plane with the real part on the x axis and the complex part on the y axis. 
  </p>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="250px-Complex_plane.png" alt="The complex plane"/></div>
  <p>
   While there is a primitive form of complex numbers in Scheme, it is simple to write your own functions separating the real and imaginary parts in your function.  This will make things fairly straight forward once you make your function to iterate over the grid of pixels.
  </p>

  <h3>Iterating over the Complex Plane</h3>
  <p>
  In order to get the pretty fractal picture, we will color each pixel in the complex plane by its escape iteration.  To do this we will use the <tt>image.ss</tt> teachpack, iterating over each point and placing a 1x1 rectangle in that spot.  This can be done with overlaying a new rectangle on each iteration and producing a new image. Here is some skeleton code of my implementation:
  </p>
  <pre>
  ;; Contract: function, step size(float), number of pixels(int), 
  ;;           lower left real (float), lower left imaginary (float) => image
  (define (escape-iterate func step_size num_pixels ll_re ll_im)
  (let ((add_point (lambda (...) (overlay/xy ... ... 
				             (rectangle 1 1 'solid color)))))
    (define (grid-iter ...)
      ;;Given my re-pixel and im-pixel, determine point to find escape
      ;;If I am complete return image, if I am done with row or column increment 
      ;;  correct pixels and iter. 
      ;;Else Determine escape number from the given function
      ;;  add_point with correct color to image
      ;;  give image to iterate again with incremented pixel numbers </pre>
  <p>
  The number of colors you use will determine your maximum number of iterations for the first part.  I just used the spectrum ('red,'orange,'yellow,...) but that's because I'm a physics nerd.  If you run out of colors just repeat them again.  Then you can write a driver function that makes the correct calls to escape-iteration.  For the picture I made, my maximum iteration was 20, but for performances purposes you might implement a small number such as 5 and then increase it once everything works.  Also I wouldn't put more than about 500 pixels in your call to "mandelbrot" and probably no more than 100 for testing, this is not the fastest way to do things but it works nicely for the elements of the language that we have introduced.
  </p>  
    
    <p>
    If you would like to save your images, the teachpack <tt><a href="save-image.ss">save-image.ss</a></tt> provides<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>save-image: img string symbol -> bool </tt><br/>
    Its first argument is the image to save, the second is the filename to be saved, and the third is the filetype to save. Use 'png for the filetype. The function returns true when the save operation was successful. For example, assuming M is an image, you can say.
    </p>    
    <pre>
    (save-image M "~\Desktop\cool-image.png" 'png) </pre>

  <h3> Extra Credit - Part One - Julia Sets</h3>
  <p>
  Where the Mandelbrot set is generated by setting z = 0 and inputing different values for c, a Julia set is generated by setting c to some set value and inputing different values of z.  While there is basically only one Mandelbrot set there are infinitely many Julia sets, some very interesting others not even fractals.  If you have followed my outline you can create a driver function almost identical to the mandelbrot function, except you need to give the c_real and c_imaginary as well. So for example the following call produces:
  </p>
  <pre>
  (julia -1 0 0.01 300 -1.75 -1.75)</pre>
  <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="julia.jpg" alt="A Julia Set"/></div>   

  
  <h3> Extra Credit - Part Two - Other iteration functions</h3>
  <p>
  The Mandelbrot and Julia set pictures we produced are an example of an escaped iteration fractal using z^2+c, you can actually use any function you want (some are not so interesting) one example I tried was:</p>
  <div style="text-align:center;">f<sub>c</sub>(z) = z<sup>3</sup> + z + c</div><br/>
  <p>
  To have a nice complete program, write some other functions that will go into the escaped iteration that will be driven like mandlebrot or julia.  
  </p>
 
  <h3>Just for Fun</h3>
  <p>
  If you have some time play around and get some pretty pictures (I would give a prize for the coolest set made this way, but alas I am a poor grad student).  Email me your best fractal pictures and I can put up a gallery or something for the world to see.
  </p>


  <h3>Turning Everything in</h3>
  <p>
  Add the appropriate test cases to the end of your definitions window so I can see some examples, such as:

  <p>
  Save the definitions window as (your_cnet_id)-Lab03.scm and put it in the <a href="http://maclab.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php?swap=dropbox">dropbox</a>.  So for example I would save my file as aterrel-Lab03.scm.  Also do yourself a favor and save your file somewhere you can look back at it (email yourself or store it on your own media).
